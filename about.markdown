<p align="justify"> Thanks for visiting my site! I am a second-year MS student in statistics at the Oregon State University (OSU). I am particularly interested in: </p>

- Spatial Statistics
- Spatio-Temporal Statistics
- Machine Learning 

with applications in, including but not limited to, environmental monitoring and prediction, resource management, and impact assessment of big data. 

<p align="justify"> Beginning this summer, we will shift our focuses to focus on spatial prediction (e.g. kriging, copula) of big forestry inventory data. In the years to come, I aim to continue to work on and explore further spatial statistics, spatio-temporal modeling, and machine learning, while completing PhD coursework in statistics (e.g. decision theory, probability theory, linear model theory). </p>

<p align="justify"> For Master's capstone project at OSU, I worked on selected spatial and temporal point processes leading up to Hawkes (or self-exciting) processes, which find applications in a wide variety of fields such as seismology, criminology, risk management, finance, etc. </p>

<p align="justify"> Prior to OSU, I attended Colorado State University (CSU)'s Master of Applied Statistics (MAS) for a semester. While CSU's MAS was prestigious and rigorous, I chose OSU for the possibility of furthering my training and education at the doctoral level. I also worked a couple of years in marketing research at two non-profit organizations (one in Seattle and one in Taiwan) and graduated with a BS in earth and space sciences from the University of Washington in 2014. </p>

<p align="justify"> When I am not musing on math or stats or programming in R, I enjoy skiing, traveling, being outdoors, and watching thriller and dark comedy films/TV series on Netflix. </p>
