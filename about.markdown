<p align="justify"> Thanks for visiting my site! I am a four-year PhD student in statistics at the Oregon State University (OSU). Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in </p>

- spatial prediction, 
- statistical computing, and 
- machine learning 

<p align="justify"> for large-scale spatial data. My other interests include deep learning and its more flexible and explainable variant models (e.g. deep Gaussian processes) for spatial and spatio-temporal data. </p> 

<p align="justify"> Since Fall 2021, we (my co-advisors Dr. Lisa Madsen & Dr. Charlotte Wickham and I) have focused on spatial prediction, statistical computing, and machine learning for big forestry inventory data with [spatial dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis#Spatial_dependence) and [excessive zero counts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-inflated_model#Zero-inflated_data_as_a_mixture_of_two_distributions). More specifically, we focus on Gaussian processes (GPs) and its variants that are faster and more scalable for larger datasets, which readily exposed me to classes of models such as stochastic processes, mixed-effects models, mixture models, copula-based models, Bayesian hierarchical models, and MCMC methods. I have also completed most PhD coursework in statistics (e.g. decision theory, probability theory, linear model theory, bayesian statistics). To further improve my algorithm design & development skillset, I also enroll in several specialization courses in statistics and computer science (e.g. mastering software development in R, data structures and algorithms, deep learning) on Coursera. </p> 

<p align="justify"> For Master's capstone project, advised by Dr. James Molyneux, I worked on selected spatial and temporal point / stochastic processes leading up to Hawkes processes (or self-exciting point processes), which find applications in a wide variety of fields such as seismology, criminology, risk management, finance, etc. </p> 

<p align="justify"> Prior to OSU, I attended Colorado State University (CSU)'s Master of Applied Statistics (MAS) for a semester. I also worked a couple of years in marketing research at two non-profit organizations and graduated with a BS in geosciences from the University of Washington. </p> 

<p align="justify"> When I am not musing on math or stats or programming in R / Python, I enjoy skiing, traveling, being outdoors, and watching thriller and dark comedy films / TV series on Netflix. </p>
