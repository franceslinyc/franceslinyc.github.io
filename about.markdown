<p align="justify"> Thanks for visiting my site! I am a four-year PhD student in statistics at the Oregon State University (OSU). I am particularly interested in: </p>

- spatial prediction, 
- statistical computing, and 
- machine learning 

<p align="justify"> with applications in, including but not limited to, environmental prediction, resource management, and impact assessment of large-scale datasets. </p>

<p align="justify"> Since Fall 2021, we have shifted our focuses to focus on spatial prediction, statistical computing, and machine learning of big forestry inventory data. I have also completed most PhD coursework in statistics (e.g. decision theory, probability theory, linear model theory, bayesian statistics). </p> 

<p align="justify"> For Master's capstone project, I worked on selected spatial and temporal point processes leading up to Hawkes processes (or self-exciting point processes), which find applications in a wide variety of fields such as seismology, criminology, risk management, finance, etc. </p>

<p align="justify"> Prior to OSU, I attended Colorado State University (CSU)'s Master of Applied Statistics (MAS) for a semester. I also worked a couple of years in marketing research at two non-profit organizations and graduated with a BS in geosciences from the University of Washington. </p>

<p align="justify"> When I am not musing on math or stats or programming in R/Python, I enjoy skiing, traveling, being outdoors, and watching thriller and dark comedy films/TV series on Netflix. </p>
