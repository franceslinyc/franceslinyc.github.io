<p align="justify"> Thanks for visiting my site! I am a second-year MS student in statistics at the Oregon State University (OSU). I am particularly interested in: </p>

- Spatial Statistics
- Spatio-Temporal Statistics
- Big Data
- Machine Learning 

with applications in, including but not limited to, environmental monitoring and prediction, resource management, and impact assessment. 

<p align="justify"> Prior to OSU, I attended Colorado State University (CSU)'s Master of Applied Statistics (MAS) for a semester. While CSU's MAS was prestigious and rigorous, I chose OSU for the possibility of furthering my training and education at the doctoral level. I also worked a couple of years in marketing research at two non-profit organizations (one in Seattle and one in Taiwan) and graduated with a BS in earth and space sciences from the University of Washington in 2014. </p>

<p align="justify"> When I am not musing on math or stats or programming in R, I enjoy skiing, traveling, being outdoors, and watching thriller and dark comedy films/TV series on Netflix. </p>
