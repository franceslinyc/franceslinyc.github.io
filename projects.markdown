#### Probability, Computing, and Simulation
**EM (Expectation-Maximization) Algorithm with An Application for Gaussian Mixture Model**, Corvallis, OR, Sep 2020 – Dec 2020

<i> Final Project for ST 541 Probability, Computing, and Simulation in Statistics
<p align="justify"> Title: EM (Expectation-Maximization) Algorithm with An Application for Gaussian Mixture Model </p>

<p align="justify"> Description: We first discuss the conditions under which EM algorithm can be used to find (local) maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of parameter, as compared to other iterative method such as Newton-Raphson, Fisher's scoring, and IRLS (iteratively reweighted least squares). Then, we briefly review MLE and posterior probability. Next, we introduce the EM algorithm in the context of the Gaussian mixture model and expand the E-step and the M-step of the algorithm in details. Finally, we apply the algorithm to a simulated dataset that follows a two-component Gaussian mixture distribution and evaluate its performance. </p>

#### Generalized Regression Models/GLMs I
**Multinomial GLMs for Multinomial Response with An Example of Brain Injury Recovery Stages**, Corvallis, OR, Sep 2020 – Dec 2020

<i> Final Project for ST 623 Generalized Regression Models (GLMs) I
<p align="justify"> Title: Multinomial GLMs for Multinomial Response with An Example of Brain Injury Recovery Stages </p>

<p align="justify"> Description: We expand beyond binary (or binomial) reponse to focus on polychotomous (or multinomial) reponse. We first differentiate ordinal reponse from nominal reponse. Then, we briefly review multinomial distribution and latent variable. Next, we define the models and discuss model assumptions and estimation. Finally, we include an example of traumatic brain injury outcomes to illustrate how the proportional-odds cumulative logit model and the baseline-category logit model are used for estimation and prediction in practice. </p>

#### Time Series

**Vector Autoregressive Models for Multivariate Time Series with A Case Study of Stock Prices**, Corvallis, OR, Jan 2020 – Mar 2020

<i> Final Project for ST 565 Time Series 
<p align="justify"> Title: Vector Autoregressive Models for Multivariate Time Series with A Case Study of Stock Prices </p>

<p align="justify"> Description: In many real-world datasets, multiple variables are at play, and they often interact with one another, producing interaction effects. Multivariate time series models such as vector autoregression (VAR) thus becomes a natural extension of its univariate autoregression (AR) model to achieve more flexibility and better forecasting. First, we discuss the differences between univariate time series and multivariate time series. Then, we introduce several key properties of multivariate time series such as stationarity, ergodicity, and cross-covariance. Next, we define the VAR model and discuss model estimation and causality. Finally, we include a case study of stock prices to illustrate how the VAR model is used for estimation and forecasting in practice. </p>

<p align="justify"> Title: Auto Insurance Claim Prediction of Porto Seguro, Brazil’s Auto and Home Insurance Company </p>

<p align="justify"> Description: We implemented several supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms such as PCA, penalized logistic regression, bagging, boosting, and random forests to determine factors that lead to file claiming and to predict whether or not drivers would file claims. Data were extracted from Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction from Kaggle and included Claim_Initiated and 56 other explanatory variables for a total of 476k observations (n=476k) in the training dataset and a total of 119k observations (n=119k) in the test dataset. Project was completed in R. </p>

**Big Data Analysis of U.S. Census data in R**, Corvallis, OR, Mar 2020 – Jun 2020

<i> Final Project for ST 538 Modern Statistical Methods for Large and Complex Data Sets
<p align="justify"> Title: Does Speaking Additional Language Predict Higher Earning Levels? A Case Study Using The U.S. Census </p>

<p align="justify"> Description: We implemented several regression models to explore the relationship between wages and additional language other than English spoken at home in the United States. Data were extracted from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and, pertaining to this analysis, we limited the scope of inference to individuals who speak English, Spanish and Chinese in the West region of the U.S. and selected from 700+ variables to include only Wages and 7 other explanatory variables for a total of 1.1 millions individuals (n=1.1m). Project was completed in R. </p>

<i> Final Project for ST 557 Multivariate Analysis
<p align="justify"> Title: Red vs. White Wine: Inference, Classification, and Clustering Based On Wine Quality and Chemical Attributes </p>

<p align="justify"> Description: I implemented inferential and predictive methods such as Hotelling T2 test, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA), k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classification, and k-means clustering to distinguish white wine from red wine and to identify key variables in determining red wine quality. Data were provided as part of the project, which included quality score, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol for a total of 1599 red wine (n1=1599) and a total of 4898 white wine (n2=4898).
