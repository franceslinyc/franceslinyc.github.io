#### Regression Analysis

**Regression Analysis of Education data in R**, Fort Collins, CO, Mar 2019 – May 2019

<p align="justify"> Title: An Investigation Into State Standardized Tests for Elementary School Students in the Denver, Colorado Area </p>

<p align="justify"> Description: I implemented a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) model and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model to explore the relationship between state standardized tests and several related variables. Data were provided as part of the project, which included test scores, English portion of the score, math portion of the score, student’s gender, student’s grade, and parents’ employment for a total of 1402 elementary school students in the Denver, Colorado area (n=1402). Project was completed in R: base R, car, and ggplot2. </p>

**Regression Analysis of Environment data in R**, Fort Collins, CO, Jan 2019 – May 2019

<p align="justify"> Title: Environment vs. Economy: The Relationship Between CO2 Per Capita And Other Indicators and The Environmental Kuzents Curve </p>

<p align="justify"> Description: I implemented a log-log multiple linear regression model with interaction terms and a log-log one-variable polynomial regression model to explore the relationship between CO2 per capita and several related variables and to test the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Data were extracted from the World Bank (WB) database, which included CO2 per capita, GDP per capita, GNI per capita, energy use per capita, and electric power consumption per capita for a total of 264 countries (n=264). Project was completed in R: base R, dplyr, car, and ggplot2. </p>
