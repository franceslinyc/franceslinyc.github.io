**Regression Analysis of Education data in R**

Title: An Investigation Into State Standardized Tests for Elementary School Students in the Denver, Colorado Area

Description: I implemented a LOESS model and a ANCOVA model to explore the relationship between state standardized tests and several related variables. Data were provided as part of the project, which included test scores, English portion of the score, math portion of the score, student’s gender, student’s grade, and parents’ employment for a total of 1402 elementary school students in the Denver, Colorado area (n=1402). Project was completed in R: base R and ggplot2.

**Regression Analysis of Environment data in R**

Title: Environment vs. Economy: The Relationship Between CO2 Per Capita And Other Indicators and The Environmental Kuzents Curve

Description: I implemented a log-log multiple linear regression model with interaction terms and a log-log one-variable polynomial regression model to explore the relationship between CO2 per capita and several related variables and to test the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Data were extracted from the World Bank (WB) database, which included CO2 per capita, GDP per capita, GNI per capita, energy use per capita, and electric power consumption per capita for a total of 264 countries (n=264). Project was completed in R: base R, ggplot2, and dplyr.
