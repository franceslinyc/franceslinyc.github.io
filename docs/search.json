To achieve flexible and scalable modeling of time series and spatial data, both the MTD and NNMP models utilize probabilistic graphical model (DAG or Bayesian network) representations, finite mixture model structures, Bayesian hierarchical model formations, and MCMC algorithms.\nMy specific contributions include incorporating the copulas in the MTD model to capture more complex dependence structures; extending the MTD model to handle zero-inflated positively-skewed data; validating the proposed models and assessing model performance through simulations and real-world data applications; developing a software package for the proposed models (using R, C++); and comparing the proposed models with other benchmark approaches, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks (using PyTorch)."

It also supports multiparameter optimization, enabling users to optimize multiple scores at once. If you want to learn more about {filtro}, check it out here.\n\n\ntidymodels\n{tidymodels} supports the full modeling workflow, from preprocessing and optimization to evaluation, postprocessing, and prediction. {filtro} fits into the preprocessing and optimization step. It is just one of several packages available, with others complementing different steps of the workflow.\nBut, why {tidymodels} instead of {scikit-learn}? If you want Python’s flexibility and a vast ML ecosystem, {scikit-learn} is an excellent choice. But if you prefer R’s syntax, value structured modeling workflows, and appreciate tools designed by statisticians and data scientists who were setting best practices long before “machine learning” became a buzzword, {tidymodels} may be the better fit.

    "text": "Behind the Curtain\n\nPR #1: All the Things, All at Once\nWeek 1-2\nMy first few weeks at Posit were packed with learning and collaboration. I had daily meetings with Max and Emil. Max brings deep expertise in modeling,machine learning and software design, while Emil is highly knowledgeable about software development, from Git, GitHub Actions CI/CD (nasty stuff!) to Positron (a VS Code–like IDE), and R’s S3 object-oriented programming (OOP) 2.\nIt’s tempting to jump straight into coding and testing, but Max taught an important lesson: before writing any code, it’s crucial to step back and think through the software design — often, the real challenge lies in the methodology, not just the implementation. Meanwhile, Emil and I did some pair programming, which led to two great learning sessions:\n\n“Everything Positron” 3 \n“Everything S3 OOP”.\n\n\n\nS3 OOP Brush-Up\nWeek 1-4\nTo be completely honest, while Xiaotian’s {mtd} 4 package is quite well-organized — and I would argue that the most challenging aspect of extending it lies more in model development than in software engineering, I had little to no experience with R’s S3 OOP system. So here I am, pretty much glued to the Advanced R and R Packages books and poking around the {tune} package (plus {yardstick} and a few others) through weeks 1 to 4 to level up my S3 OOP game.\n\n\nA Turning Point\nWeek 5\nMax, Hadley, and I met to discuss the API design for the {desirability2} package. During the discussion, Hadley demonstrated some code using S7 5 and recommended incorporating it. 😱 (That’s the “face screaming in fear” emoji because I am both thrilled and frightened — thrilled to meet him, but nervous about living up to expectations!)\nTo cap off an exciting week, Emil and I prepared and submitted {filtro} to CRAN 6.\n\n\nCRAN Horror Story to Acceptance and Dual Branches\nWeek 6\nI had to resubmit the package after making a few reasonable but minimal errors. Following the resubmission, the reviewer emailed me asking for revisions, with no further details. Gathering my courage, I replied back for clarification, and shortly after received an apology along with the great news that {filtro} is now on CRAN. 🚀\nThe S3 branch was now on CRAN, while the S7 branch lived on as the development version — many branches ahead in features and updates. In practice, though, I was juggling multiple branches, as I got used to merging, resolving conflicts, and navigating real-world Git and GitHub workflows, though I still find CI/CD concepts a bit abstract and challenging.\n\n\nThe Great S7 Migration\nWeek 5-8\n\nImplement S7 for all scoring methods\nWrite S7 tests for all scoring methods\nRefactor code using S7 (Max led the way!)\nRefactor tests accordingly\n\n\n\nWrite, Write, and Write…\nWeek 9\n\nWrite, write, and write, (but not the dissertation kind!)\n\nThough the internship was entirely remote, I had the pleasure of meeting the other intern, Jules, as well as other developers based in Europe and across the US. The most fun, though initially intimidating, experience was the tidyteam meeting, where the tidyverse, tidymodels, and r-lib 7 teams all gathered on Zoom once a month. It felt like seeing all the key people at Posit all at once 8."

Max brings deep expertise in modeling, machine learning and software design, and Emil is highly knowledgeable about software development, from Positron (a VS Code–like IDE) and R’s S3 object-oriented programming (OOP), to Posit’s developer tools, Git and GitHub Actions CI/CD. I later realized that Hannah excels at PRs, unit tests, and software design best practices, and I learned a lot from her as well!\nOne important lesson from Max is that, while it is tempting to jump straight into coding, it’s far more important to step back and think through the software design — often, the real challenge lies in the methodology, not the implementation. Meanwhile, Emil and I did some pair programming, which led to two valuable learning sessions from him:\n\n“Everything Positron” (Thanks to my advisor Charlotte for already giving me a brief intro! 3) \n“Everything S3 OOP”.\n\n\n\nS3 OOP Brush-Up\nPrior to this internship, I had little to no prior experience with R’s S3 OOP system. This is because while Xiaotian’s {mtd} 4 package is quite well-organized, it makes minimal use of OOP — though I would argue in defense that the most challenging aspect of extending {mtd} lies more in model development than in software engineering.\nSo here I am, pretty much glued to the Advanced R by Hadley and R Packages books by Hadley and Jenny, while poking around {dials}, {yardstick}, {tune} and a few other packages through weeks 1 to 4 to level up my S3 OOP game.\n\n\nA Turning Point\nWeek 5 began with a meeting between Max and Hadley to discuss the API design for the {desirability2} package, the package that powers {filtro} for multiparameter optimization. During the discussion, Hadley demonstrated some code using S7 5 and suggested incorporating it. 😱 At the time, it felt like a daunting task, and I was both thrilled and frightened — thrilled to meet him, yet nervous about living up to expectations!\nTo cap off an exciting week, Emil and I prepared and submitted {filtro} 6 to CRAN 7.\n\n\nCRAN Horror Story to Acceptance and Dual Branches\nAfter resubmitting for minor errors, the reviewer sent a vague revision request with no details, leaving me in the dark 8. Following advice from Max and Emil, I replied back for clarification, and shortly after received an apology along with the great news that {filtro} is now on CRAN. 🚀\nThe S3 branch was now on CRAN, while the S7 branch lived on as the development version, with many branches ahead in features and updates. In practice, though, I was juggling multiple branches, as I got used to merging, resolving conflicts, and navigating real-world Git and GitHub workflows, though I still find CI/CD concepts a bit abstract and challenging.\n\n\nThe Great S7 Migration 🛥\nSince meeting with Hadley in week 5, my weeks 5 to 8 were largely focused on implementing S7 for all scoring methods. I also spent a lot of time rewriting tests to match the new setup and helping with code refactoring, while Max laid the groundwork with 1-2 methods.\nThese four weeks were the most challenging yet rewarding part of my internship. I had the opportunity to work closely with Max. I learned a lot just by observing how he approached problems, structured code, and made decisions during refactoring. It was a steep learning curve, but I grew a lot — from writing cleaner, more maintable code to thinking more critically about software design and user experience.\n\n\nWrite, Write, and Write…\nFrom week 9 onward, it’s all about writing, and thankfully, not the dissertation kind. The vignette pages for all other tidy pages are phenomenal: clear, concise, and accessible. That sets the tone and adds a bit of pressure to deliver my best.\nIt also feels like just a blink from developing, refactoring, and deploying the package to now writing documentation, demos, and tutorials. But at the very least, the package website for {filtro} is up running!"

    "text": "The Journey So Far\n\nfiltro\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I primarily worked on {filtro}, an R package for filter-based supervised feature selection. Feature selection is important because it helps models prioritize the most relevant information, reducing noise, speeding up computation, and improving performance and interpretability.\nAt its core, the package allows users to compute and rank feature relevance, then select the most important features based on these scores. It also supports multiparameter optimization, enabling users to optimize multiple scores at once. If you want to learn more about {filtro}, check it out here.\n\n\ntidymodels\n{tidymodels} supports the full modeling workflow, from preprocessing and optimization to evaluation, postprocessing, and prediction. {filtro} fits into the preprocessing and optimization step. It is just one of several packages available, with others complementing different steps of the workflow.\nBut, why {tidymodels} instead of {scikit-learn}? I’ve found myself drawn to {scikit-learn} because of Python’s vast machine learning ecosystem, and since I already work with {pytorch}. At the same time, I really appreciate {tidymodels} when I’m working in R. Its syntax feels natural, the workflows are well-structured, and it reflects the kind of statistical rigor and thoughtful design that statisticians and data scientists had been shaping long before “machine learning” became a buzzword. If you want to learn more about {tidymodels}, check it out here.\n\nIn a rush? Jump to the End.\n\n\nStill reading? Stay for Behind the Scenes."

    "text": "Behind the Scenes\n\nPR #1: All the Things, All at Once\nMy first 2 weeks at Posit were packed with learning and collaboration. Max brings deep expertise in modeling, machine learning and software design, and Emil is highly knowledgeable about software development, from Positron (a VS Code–like IDE) and R’s S3 object-oriented programming (OOP), to Posit’s developer tools, Git and GitHub Actions CI/CD. I later realized that Hannah excels at PRs, unit tests, and software design best practices, and I learned a lot from her as well!\nOne important lesson from Max is that, while it is tempting to jump straight into coding, it’s far more important to step back and think through the software design — often, the real challenge lies in the methodology, not the implementation. Meanwhile, Emil and I did some pair programming, which led to two valuable learning sessions from him:\n\n“Everything Positron” (Thanks to my advisor Charlotte for already giving me a brief intro! 4) \n“Everything S3 OOP”.\n\n\n\nS3 OOP Brush-Up\nPrior to this internship, I had little to no prior experience with R’s S3 OOP system. This is because while Xiaotian’s {mtd} 5 package is quite well-organized, it makes minimal use of OOP — though I would argue in defense that the most challenging aspect of extending {mtd} lies more in model development than in software engineering.\nSo here I am, pretty much glued to the Advanced R by Hadley and R Packages books by Hadley and Jenny, while poking around {dials}, {yardstick}, {tune} and a few other packages through weeks 1 to 4 to level up my S3 OOP game.\n\n\nA Turning Point\nWeek 5 began with a meeting between Max and Hadley to discuss the API design for the {desirability2} package, the package that powers {filtro} for multiparameter optimization. During the discussion, Hadley demonstrated some code using S7 6 and suggested incorporating it. 😱 At the time, it felt like a daunting task, and I was both thrilled and frightened — thrilled to meet him, yet nervous about living up to expectations!\nTo cap off an exciting week, Emil and I prepared and submitted {filtro} 7 to CRAN 8.\n\n\nCRAN Horror Story to Acceptance and Dual Branches\nAfter resubmitting for minor errors, the reviewer sent a vague revision request with no details, leaving me in the dark. (I had this unrealistic view of the reviewer as some strict gatekeeper lurking in the shadows, always ready to reject.) Following advice from Max and Emil, I replied back for clarification, and shortly after received an apology along with the great news that {filtro} is now on CRAN. 🚀\nThe S3 branch was now on CRAN, while the S7 branch lived on as the development version, with many branches ahead in features and updates. In practice, though, I was juggling multiple branches, as I got used to merging, resolving conflicts, and navigating real-world Git and GitHub workflows, though I still find CI/CD concepts a bit abstract and challenging.\n\n\nThe Great S7 Migration 🛥\nSince meeting with Hadley in week 5, my weeks 5 to 8 were largely focused on implementing S7 for all scoring methods. I also spent a lot of time rewriting tests to match the new setup and helping with code refactoring, while Max laid the groundwork with 1-2 methods.\nThese four weeks were the most challenging yet rewarding part of my internship. I had the opportunity to work closely with Max. I learned a lot just by observing how he approached problems, structured code, and made decisions during refactoring. It was a steep learning curve, but I grew a lot — from writing cleaner, more maintable code to thinking more critically about software design and user experience.\n\n\nWrite, Write, and Write…\nFrom week 9 onward, it’s all about writing, and thankfully, not the dissertation kind. The vignette pages for all other tidy pages are phenomenal: clear, concise, and accessible. That sets the tone and adds a bit of pressure to deliver my best.\nIt also feels like just a blink from developing, refactoring, and deploying the package to now writing documentation, demos, and tutorials. But at the very least, the package website for {filtro} is up running!"

    "text": "Onward & Upward\nAs I write this, I have two weeks left in my internship, but there’s still quite a bit left to do:\nFor {filtro}:\n\nRefining documentation and writing a tidymodels developer post.\nUpdating the CRAN version to match the development version.\nFixing bugs and reviewing PRs for enhancements and new features.\n\nFor {important} 9:\n\nWorking with Max and Emil to develop the receipt steps.\n\nAnd of course:\n\nFinalizing this very post about my internship. 😀\n\nI look forward to wrapping up these projects and seeing them contribute to the broader tidymodels ecosystem.\nA big thank you to everyone at Posit for an invaluable experience, and special thanks to Max, Emil, Hannah, Simon, and Hadley for their guidance, support, and inspiration throughout this journey.\nThanks for reading this, and happy to connect!"
