To achieve robust, flexible, and scalable modeling of time series and spatial data, both the MTD and NNMP models utilize probabilistic graphical model (DAG or Bayesian network) representations, finite mixture model structures, Bayesian hierarchical model formations, and MCMC algorithms.\nMy specific contributions include incorporating the copulas in the MTD model to capture more complex and flexible dependence structures; extending the MTD model to handle zero-inflated positively-skewed data; validating the models and assessing model performance through simulations and real-world data applications; developing a software package for the proposed models (using R, C++); and comparing the proposed models with other benchmark approaches, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks (using PyTorch), to ensure robustness and accuracy."

    "text": "Behind the Curtain\n\nPR #1: All the Things, All at Once\nWeek 1-2\nMy first few weeks at Posit have been packed with learning and collaboration. I’ve had daily meetings with Max (Max Kuhn) and Emil (Emil Hvitfeldt). Max brings deep expertise in modeling and machine learning, while Emil is highly knowledgeable about software development, from Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions CI/CD (nasty stuff!) to Positron (a VS Code–like IDE), and R’s S3 object-oriented programming (OOP). 1\nIt’s tempting to jump straight into coding and testing, but Max emphasized an important lesson: before writing any code, it’s crucial to step back and think through the software design — often, the real challenge lies in the methodology, not just the implementation. Meanwhile, Emil and I did some pair programming (my first time!), which led to two great learning sessions:\n\n“Everything Positron” 2 \n“Everything S3 OOP”.\n\n\n\nS3 OOP Brush-Up\nWeek 1-4\nTo be completely honest, while Xiaotian (Xiaotian Zheng)’s {mtd} 3 package is quite well-organized — and I would argue that the most challenging aspect of extending it lies more in model development than in software engineering — I have little to no experience with R’s S3 OOP system. So here I am, pretty much glued to the Advanced R and R Packages books and poking around the {tune} package (plus {yardstick} and a few others) through weeks 1 to 4 to level up my S3 OOP game.\n\n\nA Turning Point\nWeek 5\n\nMax and I and Hadley had a meeting, and during the meeting, Hadley (Hadley Wickham) said, “Let’s do S7 OOP.” 😱 (The face screaming in fear emoji because I am thrilled and frightened — thrilled to meet him, but scared I won’t live up to the expectations!)\nPrepare for CRAN submission\n\n\n\nCRAN Horror Story & Dual (Muli) Branches\nWeek 6\n\n“CRAN horror story” to “CRAN acceptance”.\nThe S3 branch is now on CRAN, while the S7 branch lives on as the development version.\nIn practice, though, I’m juggling multiple branches, as I get used to merging, resolving merge conflicts, and navigating real-world Git and GitHub workflows.\n\n\n\nThe Great S7 Migration\nWeek 5-8\n\nImplement S7 for all scoring methods\nWrite S7 tests for all scoring methods\nRefactor code using S7 (Max led the way!)\nRefactor tests accordingly\n\n\n\nWrite, Write, and Write…\nWeek 9\n\nWrite, write, and write, (but not the dissertation kind!)\n\nThough the work is remote, I had the pleasure of meeting the other intern, Jules (Jules Walzer-Goldfeld), as well as other developers and engineers based in Europe and across the US. The most fun, though initially intimidating, has been the tidyteam meeting, where the tidyverse, tidymodels, and r-lib teams all gather on Zoom once a month."
