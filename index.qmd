> 📣 Seeking opportunities in data science, machine learning, or AI roles starting in December 2025 or later!

I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at Oregon State University. I am currently a Software Engineer Intern at [Posit Software, PBC](https://posit.co) (formerly RStudio, Inc).

Outside of work, I enjoy skiing, traveling, being outdoors, and watching thriller or dark comedy films and series on Netflix.
