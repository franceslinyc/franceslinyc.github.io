I spent the summer at Posit (formerly RStudio), where I worked on machine learning, software development, and more. 

## The Journey So Far

### filtro 

### tidymodels

## Behind the Curtain

### PR #1: All the Things, All at Once

Week 1-2

My first few weeks at Posit have been packed with learning and collaboration. I’ve had daily meetings with Max and Emil. Max brings deep expertise in modeling and machine learning, while Emil is highly knowledgeable about software development, from Git, GitHub Actions CI/CD (nasty stuff!) to Positron (a VS Code–like IDE), and R's S3 object-oriented programming (OOP) [^Hannah]. 

[^Hannah]: Though later, I found that that Hannah (Hannah Frick) also has a deep expertise in these areas, and I've learned a lot from her as well!

It’s tempting to jump straight into coding and testing, but Max taught an important lesson: before writing any code, it's crucial to step back and think through the software design — often, the real challenge lies in the methodology, not just the implementation. Meanwhile, Emil and I did some pair programming, which led to two great learning sessions:

- “Everything Positron” [^Charlotte] <br>
- “Everything S3 OOP”. 

[^Charlotte]: As a side note, I want to thank my co-advisor, Charlotte, for encouraging me to write and organize my dissertation using Positron. But, it wasn’t until this internship that I began to unlock its full potential for software development and Git integration, though it was also Charlotte who helped me get this internship. 🤩

### S3 OOP Brush-Up

Week 1-4

To be completely honest, while Xiaotian's {mtd} [^mtd] package is quite well-organized — and I would argue that the most challenging aspect of extending it lies more in model development than in software engineering, I have little to no experience with R's S3 OOP system. So here I am, pretty much glued to the *Advanced R* and *R Packages* books and poking around the {tune} package (plus {yardstick} and a few others) through weeks 1 to 4 to level up my S3 OOP game. 

[^mtd]: This is the package I build upon in my PhD dissertation. See Xiaotian's package at [https://github.com/xzheng42/mtd](https://github.com/xzheng42/mtd). My extended version will be available on GitHub in late December or later. 🤞

### A Turning Point

Week 5

Max, Hadley, and I met to discuss the API design for the {desirability2} package. During the discussion, Hadley demonstrated some code using S7 [^S7] and recommended incorporating it. 😱 (That's the "face screaming in fear" emoji because I am both thrilled and frightened — thrilled to meet him, but nervous about living up to expectations!) 

[^S7]: S7: a new OO system for R [https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/](https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/).

To cap off an exciting week, Emil and I prepared and submitted {filtro} to CRAN [^CRAN]. 

[^CRAN]: The Comprehensive R Archive Network [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org). 

### CRAN Horror Story to Acceptance and Dual Branches

Week 6

I had to resubmit the package after making some reasonable but minimal errors. Following the resubmission, the reviewer emailed me \asking for revisions, with no further details. Gathering my courage, I replied back for clarification, and shortly after received an apology along with the great news that {filtro} is now on CRAN. 🚀

The S3 branch is now on CRAN, while the S7 branch lives on as the development version. In practice, though, I’m juggling multiple branches, as I get used to merging, resolving conflicts, and navigating real-world Git and GitHub workflows — though I still find CI/CD concepts a bit abstract and challenging. 

### The Great S7 Migration

Week 5-8

- Implement S7 for all scoring methods

- Write S7 tests for all scoring methods

- Refactor code using S7 (Max led the way!)

- Refactor tests accordingly

### Write, Write, and Write... 

Week 9

- Write, write, and write, (but *not* the dissertation kind!)  

Though the internship is entirely remote, I had the pleasure of meeting the other intern, Jules, as well as other developers based in Europe and across the US. The most fun, though initially intimidating, experience has been the tidyteam meeting, where the tidyverse, tidymodels, and r-lib teams all gather on Zoom once a month. It feels like getting to see all the key people at Posit in one place [^tidymodelmeeting]. 

[^tidymodelmeeting]: I also really enjoy the weekly tidymodels meeting because it brings together people like Max, Emil, Hannah, and Simon, whose work is more relevant to mine. That said, I have to admit that sometimes I get overwhelmed by the many details involved in the 60+ packages maintained by the tidymodels team. Simon’s work on AI assistance through LLM integration, however, is quite intriguing.
