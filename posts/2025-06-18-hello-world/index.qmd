> ⚠️ **work-in-progress**

This summer, I worked at Posit (formerly RStudio), focusing on machine learning, software development, and package deployment as part of the tidymodels team. I primarily worked on {filtro}, a filter-based supervised feature selection package in R.

My team at tidymodels is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the {tidymodels} [^tidymodels] framework, a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning. It is similar in scope and purpose to {scikit-learn} in Python.

[^tidymodels]: Tidymodels [https://www.tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org). 

## The Perks of Being a Posit Intern

Though the internship was entirely remote, I had the pleasure of meeting the other intern, Jules, as well as other engineers based in Europe and across the US. 

The most fun yet initially intimidating experience was the monthly tidyteam meeting, where the tidyverse, tidymodels, and r-lib [^rlib] teams all gathered on Zoom once a month. It felt like seeing all the idols at Posit all at once. 

I also enjoyed the weekly tidymodels meetings with Max, Emil, Hannah, and Simon. The depth of the team’s *many* packages could be *a lot* to absorb at times, but it offered a glimpse into collaborative software development, the challenges of managing a large ecosystem, and communicating effectively with users and developers. Plus, Simon’s work on AI assistance through LLM integration was always a refreshing highlight. 

[^rlib]: Some of the most useful developer tools we used daily, such as {devtools}, {usethis}, {testthat}, and {rlang}, were all developed by the r-lib team [https://github.com/r-lib](https://github.com/r-lib).

## Behind the Scenes

### PR #1: All the Things, All at Once

My first 2 weeks at Posit were packed with learning and collaboration. I had daily meetings with Max and Emil. Max brings deep expertise in modeling, machine learning and software design, while Emil is highly knowledgeable about software development, from Positron (a VS Code–like IDE) and R's S3 object-oriented programming (OOP), to Posit's developer tools, Git and GitHub Actions CI/CD (nasty stuff!) [^Hannah]. 

[^Hannah]: I later found that that Hannah also has a deep expertise in these areas, and I learned a lot from her as well! 

One important lesson from Max is that, while it is tempting to jump straight into coding, it’s *far* more important to step back and think through the software design — often, the real challenge lies in the methodology, not the implementation. Meanwhile, Emil and I did some pair programming, which led to two valuable learning sessions from him:

- “Everything Positron” (Thanks to my advisor Charlotte for already giving me a brief intro! [^Charlotte]) <br>
- “Everything S3 OOP”. 

[^Charlotte]: As a side note, I want to thank my co-advisor, Charlotte, for encouraging me to write and organize my dissertation using Positron. But, it wasn’t until this internship that I unlocked its full potential for software development and Git integration, though it was also Charlotte who helped me get this internship. 🤩

### S3 OOP Brush-Up

As for R's S3 OOP system, I had little to no prior experience with it. This is because even though Xiaotian’s {mtd} [^mtd] package is quite well-organized, it makes minimal use of OOP — but I would also argue in defense that the most challenging aspect of extending {mtd} lies more in model development than in software engineering. 

So here I am, pretty much glued to the *Advanced R* by Hadley and *R Packages* books by Hadley and Jenny, while poking around the {dials}, {yardstick}, {tune} and a few other packages through weeks 1 to 4 to level up my S3 OOP game. 

[^mtd]: This is the package I build upon in my PhD dissertation. See Xiaotian's package at [https://github.com/xzheng42/mtd](https://github.com/xzheng42/mtd). My extended version will be available on GitHub in late December or later. 🤞

### A Turning Point

Week 5 began with a meeting between Max, Hadley, and me to discuss the API design for the {desirability2} package, which powers {filtro}. During the discussion, Hadley demonstrated some code using S7 [^S7] and recommended incorporating it. 😱 (The "face screaming in fear" emoji because I am both thrilled and frightened — thrilled to meet him, but nervous about living up to expectations!) 

[^S7]: S7: a new OO system for R [https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/](https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/).

To cap off an exciting week, Emil and I prepared and submitted {filtro} [^filtroname] to CRAN [^CRAN]. 

[^filtroname]: We've considered names like {filter}, {filters}, {filtrr}, {flitrrr}, and {filtron}, but unfortunately, most of them are already taken. 

[^CRAN]: Comprehensive R Archive Network [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org). 

### CRAN Horror Story to Acceptance and Dual Branches

After resubmitting for minor errors, the reviewer sent a vague revision request with no details, leaving me in the dark [^dark]. Following advice from Max and Emil, I replied back for clarification, and shortly after received an apology along with the great news that {filtro} is now on CRAN. 🚀 

[^dark]: I had this unrealistic view of the reviewer as some strict gatekeeper lurking in the shadows, always ready to reject. 

The S3 branch was now on CRAN, while the S7 branch lived on as the development version — many branches ahead in features and updates. In practice, though, I was juggling multiple branches, as I got used to merging, resolving conflicts, and navigating real-world Git and GitHub workflows, though I still find CI/CD concepts a bit abstract and challenging. 

### The Great S7 Migration 🛥

Since meeting with Hadley in week 5, my weeks 5 to 8 were largely focused on implementing S7 for all scoring methods. I also spent a lot of time rewriting tests to match the new setup and helping with code refactoring — with Max laid the groundwork with one method! 

These four weeks were the most challenging yet rewarding part of my internship. I had the opportunity to work closely with Max. I learned a lot just by observing how he approached problems, structured code, and made decisions during refactoring. It was a steep learning curve, but I grew a lot — from writing cleaner, more maintable code to thinking more critically about software design and user experience. 

### Write, Write, and Write... 

From week 9 onward, it’s all about writing — but *not* the dissertation kind. The vignette pages for all other tidy pages are phenomenal: simple, concise, and easy to follow. That sets the tone and adds a bit of pressure to deliver my best. 

It also feels like just a blink from developing, revising, and deploying the package to now writing documentation, demos, and tutorials. But at the very least, the package website for {filtro} is up running!
