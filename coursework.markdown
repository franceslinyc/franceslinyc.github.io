#### Overview 
<p align="justify"> Last year, major parts of our coursework focus on building the fundamentals: statistical methods and theories. This year, I aim to expand beyond statistical models and theories to include additional statistical methods (e.g. spatial statistics, stochastic models, Bayesian statistics) and machine learning algorithms. </p>
