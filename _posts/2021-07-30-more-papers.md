Adding two (to three) more papers: [this](https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/45838419/R_2011_03.pdf) (Bayesian inference for SEPP), [this](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1198/016214508000000148?casa_token=wDY2rXdBCuwAAAAA:oFqxMQiv8VNVtzgsK--BriBT2_f7lh_RShN7EFH6XCoF0vBWO5syGI66jSx9sGrwRlBD3G_mG7Oux1Q) (SEPP using EM/MCMC algorithm) and [this](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/src/pp_survey.pdf) (SEPP using deep learning). The last one I sort of find it myself although this paper referenced the second paper. Anyways, I thought it may be of future interest since I know nothing about deep learning yet besides knowing that they are some sort of hierarchical models.
