I am on a pause for almost all activities but instead focusing primarily on passing Master's COMP (comprehensive exam,) and looking to explore areas such as risk predictions for Master's project.

I have to also say that my interests may expand further, as I take ML (machine learning) this coming Fall and DL (deep learning) this coming Winter. In my view, 2020 may not be the best year for many, but you just have to keep pushing and try to see the light through this difficult time. Overall, I feel grateful to be in a field as exciting and practical as Statistics is. More posts about statistics, machine learning, and my Master's project to follow, I hope!
