Thanks for visiting my site! 

I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at Oregon State University. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in

- predictive modeling,  <br>
- computational statistics,  <br>
- machine learning,  <br>
- deep learning, and  <br>
- software development

focused on large and complex time series data, with applications in energy forecasting and claims prediction. My other interests include deep learning and its more flexible and explainable probabilistic variant models (e.g., deep Gaussian processes, deep Gaussian Markov Random Fields) for space and space-time modeling. Additionally, I’m interested in exploring machine learning and AI techniques across a variety of domains and applications. 

## PhD

For my PhD dissertation, advised by Dr. Lisa Madsen and Dr. Charlotte Wickham (now at Posit Software, PBC), I focus on the Markov MTD (Mixture Transition Distribution) time series models and the Bayesian NNMP (Nearest-Neighbor Mixture Process) spatial models for time series forecasting and spatial prediction, as developed by Zheng et al. and presented in [[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2021.1981342), [[2]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2805), and [[3]](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume-18/issue-4/Nearest-Neighbor-Mixture-Models-for-Non-Gaussian-Spatial-Processes/10.1214/23-BA1405.full). To achieve robust, flexible, and scalable modeling of time series and spatial data, both the MTD and NNMP models utilize probabilistic graphical model (DAG or Bayesian network) representations, finite mixture model structures, Bayesian hierarchical model formations, and MCMC algorithms.

My specific contributions include incorporating the copulas in the MTD model to capture more complex and flexible dependence structures; extending the MTD model to handle zero-inflated positively-skewed data; validating the models and assessing model performance through simulations and real-world data applications; developing a software package for the proposed models (using `R`, `C++`); and comparing the proposed models with other benchmark approaches, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks (using `PyTorch`), to ensure robustness and accuracy.

## Master's

For my Master’s capstone project, advised by Dr. James Molyneux, I worked on selected spatial and temporal point processes leading up to Hawkes processes (or self-exciting point processes), which find applications in fields such as seismology, criminology, risk management, finance, etc.
